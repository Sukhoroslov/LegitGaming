            <div class="character">
                <p>The story of Cuphead begins with Studio MDHR, an indie game development company founded by brothers Chad and Jared Moldenhauer. Before their breakout success, Studio MDHR was virtually unknown, with no major projects under its belt. Driven by a passion for classic animation and challenging games, the brothers took a leap of faith to create something that felt truly unique. Inspired by their love for retro cartoons and old-school run-and-gun gameplay, they began crafting a game that would pay homage to a bygone era of art and design.</p>
                <img src="../images/willy.png" alt="image for history">
                <p>The visual style of Cuphead is a direct nod to the rubber hose animation of the 1930s, popularized by studios like Fleischer and early Disney. Animators like Max Fleischer, who created Betty Boop and Popeye the Sailor, and Walt Disney's early works, such as Steamboat Willie, clearly influenced the game’s surreal and exaggerated aesthetic. Every frame of animation in Cuphead was painstakingly hand-drawn, just as it would have been in the golden age of cartoons. Even the backgrounds were painted using watercolor techniques, staying true to the period’s style.</p>
                <img src="../images/cphimg2.png" alt="image for history2">
                <p>The game’s dark themes and punishing difficulty were also inspired by a mix of sources. The brothers cited old fairy tales, where whimsical stories often carried darker undertones, as a key influence. In terms of gameplay, Cuphead drew inspiration from classic arcade shooters and notoriously challenging games like Contra and Dark Souls. However, its heart lies in the labor of love from a team of creators who poured their resources—and sometimes their personal savings—into a vision.

                    When Cuphead finally launched in 2017, it was more than just a game; it was a cultural phenomenon. Its painstaking devotion to authenticity, both visually and mechanically, not only captivated players but also set a new standard for what indie games could achieve.
