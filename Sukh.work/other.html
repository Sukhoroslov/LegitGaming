                <h3> The Plot</h3>
                <p>In Cuphead, players are introduced to the titular character and his brother, Mugman, two carefree inhabitants of the whimsical Inkwell Isle. Their troubles begin when they wander into the Devil’s casino and lose a high-stakes gamble, putting their souls on the line. Desperate to save themselves, the brothers strike a deal with the Devil: collect the souls of his debtors in exchange for their freedom. What follows is a series of perilous battles against colorful, eccentric bosses scattered across the island. Along the way, Cuphead and Mugman learn valuable lessons about teamwork, perseverance, and the consequences of temptation. It’s a quirky yet dark tale wrapped in vintage cartoon charm, where every victory feels hard-earned and every defeat is a reminder of the stakes.</p>

                <h3>The DLC</h3>
                <p>The Delicious Last Course is a flavorful expansion to the Cuphead adventure. The brothers team up with Ms. Chalice, a spirited new character with unique abilities, as they embark on a quest to restore her to the land of the living. Guided by the mysterious Chef Saltbaker, the trio must traverse new areas of Inkwell Isle and face a fresh roster of challenging bosses. The goal is to gather special ingredients needed to bake the Wondertart, a magical confection with transformative powers. However, as the journey unfolds, not everything is as it seems. With even more inventive boss battles, gorgeous animations, and catchy tunes, The Delicious Last Course adds another layer of charm and challenge to an already iconic game.</p>

                <h3>Interesting facts</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Hand-Drawn Perfection:</strong> Every single frame of animation in <em>Cuphead</em> was hand-drawn and inked, taking inspiration from 1930s cartoons. It’s a rare feat in modern gaming and a huge reason why the game took nearly seven years to develop.</li>
                    <li><strong>A True Family Project:</strong> Studio MDHR wasn’t just founded by the Moldenhauer brothers—their family members, including their wives and friends, contributed to the game’s development.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jazz Masterpieces:</strong> The game’s soundtrack features over three hours of original jazz compositions, performed by live musicians. It perfectly captures the era’s vibe and adds an unforgettable layer to the experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tough Love from Nintendo:</strong> When <em>Cuphead</em> was first pitched, Nintendo famously rejected it for being "too hard." However, it later became a hit on the Nintendo Switch.</li>
                    <li><strong>Guinness World Record:</strong> <em>Cuphead</em> holds a Guinness World Record for the most boss battles in a run-and-gun game, featuring a staggering 19 boss fights in the base game alone.</li>
