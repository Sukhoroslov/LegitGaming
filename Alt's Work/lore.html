        <h2>The Story Behind the Madness</h2>
        <div class="lore-section">
            <h3>The Murkoff Corporation</h3>
            <p>At the heart of the terror lies the shadowy Murkoff Corporation. Operating behind a facade of legitimate medical research, Murkoff conducted experiments within Mount Massive Asylum that defied ethics and humanity. Their involvement with the creation of psychological horrors led to the birth of unspeakable entities, including the terrifying Walrider Project, which was designed to push the boundaries of the human mind through experimental manipulation of consciousness. This madness is the reason the asylum exists in the state that it does today.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Walrider Project:</strong> Using nanotechnology, Murkoff sought to manipulate human consciousness. The result? A malevolent, nearly uncontrollable entity that turned on its creators, and is now a terrifying force within the asylum.</li>
                <li><strong>Corruption and Greed:</strong> Driven by profit, Murkoff exploited vulnerable patients, subjecting them to inhumane experiments that left them broken, transformed, or worse—forever altered by the corporation’s twisted goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Secrecy:</strong> Documents and audio logs scattered throughout the asylum reveal the true extent of Murkoff's misdeeds. Their desire for control, wealth, and power ultimately led them down a path of unimaginable horror.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="lore-section">
            <h3>Mount Massive Asylum</h3>
            <p>The asylum itself is a character in the story—its eerie halls and crumbling walls hold countless secrets. Once a beacon of mental healthcare, it became a prison of torment and pain. Patients were subjected to terrible, often bizarre experiments, turning them into tortured souls who still roam its halls.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Male Ward:</strong> A haunting space overrun by hostile patients, filled with the echoes of suffering. These halls still echo with their screams.</li>
                <li><strong>Chapel:</strong> Twisted religious imagery and rituals suggest a descent into madness by patients and staff alike, creating a chilling juxtaposition of faith and insanity.</li>
                <li><strong>Laboratories:</strong> The birthplace of the Walrider and countless other horrors, these sterile yet blood-soaked rooms tell a story of science gone awry.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="lore-section">
            <h3>Survivors and Witnesses</h3>
            <p>Throughout the asylum, you encounter those who have survived Murkoff's atrocities. Their fragmented stories paint a grim picture of the events that unfolded.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Father Martin:</strong> A patient turned religious fanatic, he believes the Walrider is a divine force. His cryptic prophecies lead some to their doom.</li>
                <li><strong>The Variants:</strong> Broken minds and bodies that roam the halls, reminders of Murkoff's inhumane experiments.</li>
                <li><strong>Miles Upshur:</strong> A journalist whose investigation unveils the asylum’s darkest secrets. His story is one of descent into horror.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="lore-section">
            <h3>The Psychological Horror</h3>
            <p>Outlast is not just a story of physical survival but a descent into psychological terror. The asylum's atmosphere erodes the sanity of anyone who lingers too long.</p>
            <p>Even the asylum's architecture seems alive, as though the walls themselves bear witness to the atrocities committed within. The building's design, with its endless, twisting corridors and hidden passages, transforms into an antagonist. Those who survive the horrors often speak of their mental state being fractured, unable to discern reality from the shadows that haunt them.</p>
