        <h2>Survival in the Shadows</h2>
        <div class="gameplay-section">
            <h3>Core Gameplay Mechanics</h3>
            <p>Outlast is a first-person survival horror game that challenges players to rely on stealth and exploration rather than combat. You play as investigative journalist Miles Upshur, who ventures into the nightmarish Mount Massive Asylum. Armed only with a night-vision camera, your goal is to uncover the truth behind the asylum's dark secrets while avoiding its terrifying inhabitants.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stealth:</strong> Avoid being detected by enemies by staying in the shadows, using the environment to your advantage, and hiding in lockers or under beds.</li>
                <li><strong>Night Vision:</strong> Your camera is equipped with night vision, which allows you to see in the dark but drains the battery, requiring careful resource management.</li>
                <li><strong>No Combat:</strong> You cannot fight back against the dangers within the asylum. Running, hiding, and outsmarting your foes are your only options for survival.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="gameplay-section">
            <h3>Resource Management</h3>
            <p>Outlast forces players to manage their limited resources carefully. Batteries for your camera are scattered throughout the environment, and they are essential for navigating the asylum’s dark corridors. As the battery life drains, you must balance your usage of night vision with the need to preserve light for survival. Running out of batteries at the wrong time can leave you vulnerable to enemies lurking in the darkness.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Batteries:</strong> Limited and hard to find, batteries are key to maintaining your light source. Use them sparingly and plan your route carefully.</li>
                <li><strong>Health:</strong> While there is no direct health system, the game's intense moments can affect your progress. Finding safe areas to rest is important, but you're always vulnerable to attack.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="gameplay-section">
            <h3>Exploring the Asylum</h3>
            <p>The Mount Massive Asylum is an intricate labyrinth, and exploration is crucial for uncovering the story and surviving. As you explore, you’ll come across documents, audio logs, and various other items that piece together the twisted history of the asylum and its dark secrets.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environmental Storytelling:</strong> Look for notes, recordings, and clues left behind by the asylum's inhabitants and previous investigators. These items add depth to the narrative and provide insight into the horrors that transpired.</li>
                <li><strong>Key Areas:</strong> You'll visit different sections of the asylum, including the Male Ward, the Laboratories, and the Chapel. Each area has its own unique atmosphere and challenges to overcome.</li>
                <li><strong>Enemy Encounters:</strong> While the game is not combat-based, the asylum is full of terrifying enemies. Learn their movements and strategies for evading them to stay alive.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="gameplay-section">
            <h3>Atmosphere and Tension</h3>
            <p>The gameplay is designed to create an overwhelming sense of dread and anxiety. The constant feeling of being watched, combined with the terrifying sounds and the eerie visual design of the asylum, keep players on edge. The game’s oppressive atmosphere heightens the tension and ensures that every corner and every dark hallway could hold danger.</p>
            <p>The minimal lighting, sudden noises, and distant screams all contribute to an atmosphere that makes the player feel trapped in a never-ending nightmare. The psychological pressure of not knowing what lurks around the corner builds the horror experience, making every moment tense and full of fear.</p>
