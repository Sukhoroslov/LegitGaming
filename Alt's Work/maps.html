        <h2>Explore the Terrifying Grounds of Mount Massive</h2>
        <div class="map-section">
            <h3>The Asylum's Layout</h3>
            <p>The Mount Massive Asylum is a maze of dark corridors, forgotten rooms, and abandoned spaces. Its eerie architecture adds to the psychological horror of the game, with its seemingly endless hallways and hidden rooms that challenge both your mind and your sense of direction. Below, we delve into key areas within the asylum that players must explore to uncover its many secrets:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Male Ward:</strong> This area is filled with dangerous inmates and serves as one of the primary locations to hide from pursuers. Its dark, claustrophobic hallways are littered with broken furniture and bloodstains.</li>
                <li><strong>Administration:</strong> Once the heart of the asylum's operations, this area is now abandoned. Still, its security systems and computer terminals hold vital information about the experiments conducted within.</li>
                <li><strong>Chapel:</strong> A disturbing area with religious imagery twisted by madness. It serves as a key location for important story beats, and its desolate, haunting atmosphere provides an unsettling backdrop.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="map-section">
            <h3>Exploring Mount Massive</h3>
            <p>The entire facility is designed to evoke a sense of unease. The design of the asylum is not only a physical maze but also a psychological one. Players will find themselves constantly disoriented, with rooms that look identical and corridors that seem to loop back upon themselves. As you navigate this environment, keep an eye out for environmental storytelling—small details that hint at the dark past of the institution.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Laboratories:</strong> The heart of the Murkoff Corporation’s sinister experiments. These cold, sterile rooms are contrasted by the blood and gore of the “Walrider” project.</li>
                <li><strong>Guard Towers:</strong> Situated around the perimeter of the asylum, the guard towers provide a sense of security—but are ultimately useless against the horrors lurking within the building.</li>
                <li><strong>Ventilation Systems:</strong> These hidden tunnels offer a brief escape route from danger, but navigating them is just as perilous. Watch out for the many traps and lurking threats that can make these spaces their home.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="map-section">
            <h3>The Challenges of Navigation</h3>
            <p>When exploring the Mount Massive Asylum, navigation is one of the key challenges. The winding, narrow paths and ever-present sense of danger make every decision critical. The lack of proper lighting adds to the tension, with only a flashlight or other light sources to guide you. Along with the game's pacing, the physical challenges of moving through the asylum become an obstacle in themselves.</p>
            <p>The layout encourages exploration, but the consequences of being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time are often fatal. As you make your way deeper into the institution, the horrors escalate, and you must stay on guard. Every corner hides something waiting to prey on your vulnerability, creating a constant threat that is never fully gone.</p>
