2. Structure: The Matrix Structure: Far from a basic site structure, the matrix structure takes
the form of a vast network of pages without a predefined journey for users to follow. For
that reason, it’s also known as a webbed website structure.
It’s almost (but not quite) a lack of structure, and that’s the point; it makes it easy for
users to have the exact experience that suits their needs, total freedom to browse. It’s
often used in large sites with interconnected content, allowing users to navigate freely
between related pages; think e-commerce sites like Amazon or news websites.
So you’ll still have a main page along with basic parent pages and their child pages but
the order in which users find them is largely irrelevant. Thorough internal linking ensures
they can find what they’re looking for in as few clicks as possible.
