            <h2>Weapon Skin Rarity</h2>
            <p>In CS:GO, weapon skins are categorized into different rarities. The rarity affects the availability, appearance, and price of skins. Skins can range from consumer-grade (most common) to covert (rare and valuable). For instance, the "AK-47 | Redline" is a classified skin, while the "AWP | Dragon Lore" is covert, and often extremely expensive due to its rarity.</p>
            <p>Rare skins can sometimes fetch hundreds or even thousands of dollars, depending on demand and condition. Rarity plays a big role in trading, as high-rarity skins attract collectors and investors.</p>

            <h2>Float Value</h2>
            <p>Float is a numerical value that determines the wear and condition of a skin, ranging from 0.00 (factory new) to 1.00 (battle-scarred). Skins in pristine condition (low float) are generally more valuable than those with higher float values, which appear more worn or damaged.</p>
            <p>For example, an "AK-47 | Case Hardened" with a low float value may cost significantly more than the same skin with a high float. The float value also affects the visual appearance of the skin, with low float skins looking much cleaner and more vibrant.</p>

            <h2>Gun Pattern</h2>
            <p>Some skins in CS:GO have unique patterns that influence their appearance and value. For example, the "AK-47 | Case Hardened" has different patterns with varying colors and designs. Certain patterns are considered more desirable, making them more expensive and sought after by collectors.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the "M4A4 | Howl" skin is one of the rarest in the game, partly because it was removed from the case after its design was considered controversial. The rarity of the pattern is a significant factor in its value on the market.</p>

            <h2>Case Openings and Market Trends</h2>
            <p>Opening cases in CS:GO is one of the most popular methods for obtaining skins. However, the odds of getting a rare skin are quite low. Players may open multiple cases without getting anything valuable, while others may hit the jackpot with a coveted item.</p>
            <p>Market trends show that some skins appreciate over time, while others may lose value based on community interest, game updates, or overall demand. Popular skins like the "AWP | Dragon Lore" or "Karambit | Fade" tend to remain valuable, whereas skins from older cases may become less desirable.</p>

            <h2>Trading and Market Place</h2>
            <p>The Steam Community Market is the primary platform for trading skins in CS:GO. Players can buy, sell, and trade skins using Steam Wallet funds. The market is dynamic, with prices constantly fluctuating based on supply and demand.</p>
            <p>Traders often monitor the market closely to buy low and sell high, trying to make a profit. Some players also engage in "skin gambling," where they wager skins on third-party sites, hoping to win rare or valuable items.</p>
